#  Bunker Escape - Motion Caputer & Virtual Reality Project

This is a group project created as a Final Project for the Rhodes College, 
Human-Computer Interaction and Virtual Reality course. This assignment for this project
was to create a unique VR experience utilizing all the skills learned through the couse of the
class.

In Serial Killer, our team:
- Utilized Unity 3D to create a unique VR video game experience
- Implemented Motive's OptiTrack Motion Capture system to allow for a more realistic and spacious
  VR environment
- Levereged Unity's pathfinding to create an intelligent enemy to chase the player and add
  difficulty to the game
- Utilized the HTC Vive PRO to provide an unteathered VR experience 

  
##  GAME SUMMARY

  In this new and original game, the player (you ðŸ«µ), is transported to a whole new world (a dusty bunker)
  throught the magic of motion capture technology and the HTC Vive PRO. However, you are not alone! You've
  disturbed an unfortunate, housing-insecure zombie that's hungry and looking for you! Luckily, there is a way
  out: a heavy, locked, door. If your are to survive, you must use your wits, stealth skills, and brain (while 
  you still have it) to find the hidden key and open your path to freedom!
